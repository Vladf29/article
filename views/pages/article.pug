They let you separate your JavaScript into separate files and they protect you and everyone else on your team from muddying up the global scope. It's also worth considering the fact that the dinosaurs didn't use modules and now they're extinct.
                            //- p   To take advantage of modules in modern ES6 JavaScript, simply use the

                            //- p Somehow we ended up with five major module loading systems.
                            //- p To solve module resolution in the browser, the Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD) standard was created. The AMD library require.js is used by many front-end libraries because it is much faster than CommonJS, but this unfortunately created two different standards.

                            //- p As JavaScript became more complex, SystemJS entered the scene as a more complete module resolution system that can import all of the standard JavaScript module types as well as "global" modules into its own namespace. It has some nice bells and whistles that the other systems don't have, but takes a bit of configuration to set up in your project.
                            //- p Next, we see that CommonJS uses

                            //-     |, which is also not in the ECMAScript standard. CommonJS relies on Node or another library to define the
